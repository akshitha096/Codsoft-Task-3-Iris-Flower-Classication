# Codsoft-Task-3-Iris-Flower-classication

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on classifying the Iris flower species using popular algorithms. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of pattern recognition, and this project aims to implement and compare different classification techniques.

The Iris flower dataset consists of 150 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the lengths and the widths of the sepals and petals. The goal is to classify the flowers into their respective species based on these features.
